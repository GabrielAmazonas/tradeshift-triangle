# Tradeshift - Triangle Challenge

## Running this project

Node.js and NPM are needed to run this project. Get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After installing Node.js,

1. git clone https://github.com/GabrielAmazonas/tradeshift-triangle
2. cd tradeshift-triangle
3. npm install
4. npm start

## Summary
This project is purposely over-engineered.The general idea is to serve as a starting-point for more complex React-Redux projects.
Also, you can use it to check if, given 3 side sizes, a triangle is formed and which kind of triangle it forms, if it does.

## Cool-Things
The Tradeshift UI library can be easily integrated in new React projects, as shown in this example. Also, as React can be used in any Front-End project (Inside Angular or Vue projects, for example) it can be added gradually in any project, too.

## TO-DO
Include API requests (server-side interaction) on the actions used by the components.
Include Component Rendering test examples.


## Front-End Architecture
- React - Component Creation Library
- Redux - Client-Side state management library
- Styled Components - Component Styling management library
- Jest - Front-End Testing Library
- Tradeshift UI - UI Components Library
